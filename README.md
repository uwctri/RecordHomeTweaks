# Record Home Tweaks - Redcap External Module

## What does it do?

Record home tweaks is a collection of small adjustments that can be made to the record home screen. Major features include moving one event to a seperate "System" table, organizing events into tabs, hiding rows, and adjusting display of titles.

## Installing

This EM isn't available to install via redcap's EM database so you'll need to install to your modules folder (i.e. `redcap/modules/record_home_tweaks_v1.0.0`) manually if you'd like to use it.
