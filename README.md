# Record Home Tweaks - Redcap External Module

## What does it do?

Record home tweaks is a collection of small adjustments that can be made to the record home screen. Features include:

* Adding a alert to the top of the Record Home page
* Editing the alignment/wrapping of headers in the instrument/event table
* Removing repeating instrument tables
* Move an event to a seperate "System Managment" table to signal that it doesn't represent a typical visit
* Hide rows (i.e. hide a form) in the instrument/event table
* Hide columns (i.e. hide an event) in the instrument/event table
* Highlight an event's column if today is its scheduled day or if the event is "in window".
* Group events into tabs

## Installing

You can install the module from the REDCap EM repo or drop it directly in your modules folder (i.e. `redcap/modules/record_home_tweaks_v1.0.0`)
